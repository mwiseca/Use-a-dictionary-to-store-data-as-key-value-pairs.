Use a dictionary to store data as key value pairs.
This program uses a python dictionary to store data.
it can be used for anything. I used some english to french translations
as a example.
If you are going to use it for names and phone numbers i'd do it like this
"name": "111-000-0000", The number must be a string in this case otherwise
python will subtract the numbers when using hyphens.
